// Fix build error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module '@aws-amplify/ui-vue'. [...] implicitly has an 'any' type.
// There are types at 'node_modules/@aws-amplify/ui-vue/dist/src/index.d.ts', but this result could not be resolved when respecting package.json "exports".
// The '@aws-amplify/ui-vue' library may need to update its package.json or typings.

// Waiting for ui-vue to export types in package.json
